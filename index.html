                            In 2010 I started to learn C programming. My motivation was that I needed some software that did not exist. So I decided to create it on my own and while I was doing this I discovered my passion for programming. Since then I have realized countless projects. Therefore I learned several languages targeting a lot of subject areas inluding desktop development, mobile development, embedded development and webdesign..

                                    I am not a studied computer scientist or electronics engineer. My actual educational background is that of an industrial mechanic. In 2008 I came to CNC machining through a job change. Since then I work as a CNC programmer and operator.
                                </p>
                                <p class="interDescP">
                                    As already mentioned, I started to deal with programming in 2010. This was not a private decision but had quite practical reasons that concerned my work as a CNC programmer. We had problems to find suitable software to transfer and archive CNC programs with our specific EPL2 controllers to a Windows computer.
                                </p>
                                <p class="interDescP">
                                    So I developed a suitable software. What started as a small project quickly developed into a complex application with far more functions than originally planned. During this project I could learn a lot and discovered my passion for programming. I haven't developed the CNC Suite application for a long time, but I update it from time to time and it is also available in the Windows Store. You can find the resources <a href="#cncSuiteContainer">below in my Portfolio</a>.
                                </p>
                                <p class="interDescP">
                                    Beside the CNC Suite Application I worked on several small Projects to learn more about C++ and C Programming. In this time I discovered embedded programming in C and also in assembly language. In this time I was very interested in assembly language, I bought a book from Daniel Kussworm about modern x86 assembly language programming. You can see results of my experiments in the <a href="https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ALaRoomy%2FCnC-Suite++language%3AAssembly&type=code" target="_blank">CNC Suite application repository</a>.
                                </p>

                                    In 2015 I had the idea to build technical designer furniture. Therefore, I have made myself self-employed part-time. This was for me a great playground where I could develop freely and learned a lot about electronics development, microcontroller programming, manual craft and CAD construction. To present my products and distribute them online I also had to learn the basics in Website programming in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also learned how to use the 3D printer and how to design 3D models with Fusion 360. A small insight on what I created can be viewed on my <a href="https://laroomy.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">old website</a>. I ended this venture in 2019 as the cost to revenue ratio was not appropriate. But I have gained a lot of knowledge and insight from it.

                                    During this time I also started to deal intensively with Bluetooth hardware and the control through apps. This gave birth to the idea that forms the basis for my current project, the <a href="#laroomySystemContainer">LaRoomy Bluetooth Control System</a>.

                        The LaRoomy Bluetooth-Control-System is made to quickly implement Bluetooth remote control features in embedded projects. It consists of the LaRoomy App and the LaRoomy API, a remote framework for embedded systems.

                    <p>
                        The cababilities of a remote device will be fetched by the LaRoomy App during the connection process and presented to the user. Now the user is able to control the remote device with the LaRoomy App through a unique app view customized for the specific remote device.

                        While working as a CNC-Programmer it was a recurrent problem to find an application for modern systems which is capable to communicate with older machines via RS232 interface to transmit G-Code based CNC programs. So I decided to create this app by myself.

                        On my way to this objective and when I published the first UWP app <b>EPL-Exchange</b> (written in C#) on the Microsoft Store, I realized that this is not only a problem of mine. 
                        Many other companies using older machines are concerned by this subject. With the feedback to my existing apps and information and requests from other companies, I created different solutions to cover many requirements including a platform independent wireless interface.

                            EPL Exchange is a tool to edit text based nc files and transmit them to or from a cnc machine. It is written for the Universal Window Platfrom in C#. When I later started to create electronic constructions, I added a terminal component to communicate with pcb modules over a UART interface.

                            The purpose of the Transfer app is to exchange programs with older cnc machines via RS232 interface. After publishing my app EPL-Exchange in the Microsoft Store, I often had user request how to run the app on older windows systems. For an UWP app this is not possible, but a win32 app could be downward compatible. Therefore the app is intentionally kept simple. It runs down to Windows XP SP1.

                            One issue bothered me all the time: there was always the need for a cable connected to the machine and a desktop pc is needed in the vicinity of the machine. This was my motivation to develop a wireless and platform independent solution. A device based on an ESP8266 controller. The controller provides a websocket browser interface to enter or save programs and to transmit them to the machine. The controller converts the data and sends it over UART to a RS232 level converter.

                            After some experiments I had the proove of concept, so I created the board with Eagle PCB Layout Editor. The case is created with Autodesk Fusion 360 and printed with my 3D printer. The firmware for the ESP8266 is written in C++ with Visual Studio Code. The front end web interface is written in html/css/javascript.
